     "longDesc": "Radio Swiss Jazz is the perfect companion at any time of the day. Swinging standards from the Great American songbook and driving jazz beads of innovative bebop instrumentalists are broadcast around the clock without advertising and moderation. Recordings of soul-related soul and blues music also provide a varied listening experience. Radio Swiss Jazz also promotes local musicians: around one third of the songs are made by artists from Switzerland. Pure music, to relax, to discover and to enjoy."
