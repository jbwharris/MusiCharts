# MusiCharts
MusiCharts is an app I created to listen to my favourite radio stations, visualising my listening habits and uploading the music data to my Last.fm profile. I was looking for an iOS app that lets you listen to radio stations and "scrobble" now playing songs to Last.fm but for a long time couldn't find anything good that covers my needs. One day when I was doing one of my google searches I stumbled upon [Swift-Radio-Pro](https://github.com/analogcode/Swift-Radio-Pro) and it inspired me so much that I decided to write my own radio scrobbling app. The source code is open with hope to inspire someone else to solve a similar problem :)
